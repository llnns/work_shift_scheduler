# Work Shift Scheduler
Simple JS work shift people scheduler

## How it works?
Add work shifts in the calendar with a start and end hour, score per minute and the number of people required for the shift.
Add people and then click process. The simple greedy alg will place people in shifts randomaly trying to balance people's score along all shifts.

This is a very simple prove-of-concept about scheduling people.

Made to learn basics of bootstrap and train my rusty JS.
